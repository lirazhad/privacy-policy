# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** December 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how this application ("the App") handles user information.

## Camera Usage
The App uses the device camera solely to allow users to take photos of receipts for personal or business expense tracking.

The camera is accessed **only after the user explicitly initiates a photo capture**.  
The App does not access the camera in the background.

## Data Collection
The App does **not collect, store, or transmit personal data automatically**.

Photos taken using the camera remain on the user's device unless the user explicitly chooses to upload, export, or share them.

## Data Sharing
The App does **not sell, share, or transfer personal data** to third parties.

## Data Security
All data processing is performed locally on the device unless otherwise stated within the App.  
We take reasonable measures to protect user data.

## Children's Privacy
The App is not intended for children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  
Any changes will be posted on this page.
