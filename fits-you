Collecting and Using Your Personal Data
Types of Data Collected
Personal Data
While using Our Service, We may ask You to provide Us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify You, such as:

Email address
First and last name
Health and Fitness Data
What we access/collect: step count, calories burned, workouts (type, duration, intensity), body metrics (e.g., weight/height if entered), and nutrition information (e.g., estimated calorie intake, macros) that You enter or authorize.

Sources: Your Device sensors (e.g., pedometer), and—only with Your explicit permission—connected health services such as Google Fit and Apple HealthKit. We access only the specific data types You approve.

Purpose: to provide core app functionality including fitness tracking, progress reports, insights, and personalized recommendations.

Storage: Health data is stored locally on Your device. It is not transmitted to our servers.

Sharing: We do not share Health Data with any third parties. We do not use advertising or analytics SDKs that process Health Data.

Control: You can revoke access to Health Data at any time via Your Device settings (e.g., Health permissions). Within the App, You can also delete Health Data that the App stores locally.

Technical and Usage Data
We may collect limited technical information to ensure security and correct operation, such as:

Device type and operating system version
Diagnostic logs and crash data
Approximate usage events within the App (e.g., features used)
Where collected, this information is used solely to maintain and improve the Service. We do not sell this data or share it with third parties.

Information Collected while Using the Application
With Your prior permission, the App may access:

Camera and Photo Library – for features such as scanning or attaching images You choose to use. Content remains on Your device unless You initiate export or sharing.
You can enable or disable access through Your Device settings at any time.

Use of Your Personal Data
The Company may use Personal Data for the following purposes:

To provide and maintain our Service, including monitoring for reliability and performance.
To manage Your Account (if applicable) and enable App features You request.
To contact You regarding important notices about the App (e.g., security or feature updates).
To respond to and manage Your requests.
To analyze and improve the Service and Your experience.
No Sharing with Third Parties
We do not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose Your Personal Data or Health Data to any third parties. We do not use third-party advertising or analytics SDKs that access Your Personal Data or Health Data.

Data does not leave Your device except when You choose to export, back up, or sync data using services You control (e.g., your OS cloud backup). When You connect Google Fit or Apple HealthKit, we read data You authorize; we do not write to or share Your data with other parties.

Retention of Your Personal Data
Personal Data and Health Data stored by the App are retained only as long as necessary to provide the Service on Your device. You can delete data at any time within the App (where available) or by uninstalling the App, which removes locally stored data. If any Personal Data is stored off-device because You contacted us (e.g., email support), we retain it only as long as needed to handle the request or as required by law.

Transfer of Your Personal Data
The App is designed so that Health Data remains on Your device and is not routinely transferred to our systems. We do not transfer Personal Data to other countries or organizations. If You voluntarily use external services (e.g., email support, OS-level backups, Google Fit/Apple HealthKit), their processing is governed by their respective policies.

Delete Your Personal Data
You have the right to delete or request deletion of Personal Data and Health Data. You may:

Revoke health permissions in Your Device settings.
Delete in-app data (where available) or uninstall the App to remove locally stored data.
Contact Us to request deletion of any information You previously provided directly to Us (e.g., via email). We will process deletion requests within 30 days unless a longer period is required by law.
Disclosure of Your Personal Data
We do not disclose Your Personal Data to third parties. If required by law, court order, or governmental request, we may disclose the minimum necessary information to comply with legal obligations.

Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures, including encryption in transit (where applicable) and device-level security. No method of electronic storage is 100% secure; however, we strive to protect Your data to a commercially reasonable standard.

Children's Privacy
Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If You are a parent or guardian and become aware that Your child has provided Personal Data to Us, please contact Us so that we can take appropriate action.

Links to Other Websites
The Service may contain links to external websites or services that are not operated by Us. If You click a third-party link, You will be directed to that third party. We strongly advise You to review the privacy policy of every site You visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.

Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page and, where appropriate, by providing a notice within the App.
